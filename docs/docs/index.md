[Ampersand](https://www.withampersand.com) is a config-first platform for SaaS builders who are creatinguser-facing integrations. We allow you to:

- Read data from your customer's SaaS
- Write data to your customer's SaaS
- Coming soon: subscribe to events (creates, deletes, and field changes) in your customer's SaaS

Here's an overview of the Ampersand platform:

The key components include:

- **Manifest file**: an `amp.yaml` file, where you define all your integrations: API to connect to, type of data, configuration values available to your end users, and how you'd like to connect it to the rest of your stack (via direct connection to your data store, API calls, or webhooks).
- **Ampersand integration service**: we offer a managed service that keeps tracks each of your customer‚Äôs configurations, and makes the appropriate API calls to your customer's SaaS, while optimizing for cost, handling retries and error message parsing.
